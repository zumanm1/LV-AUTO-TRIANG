## TESTING STRATEGY

### Testing Philosophy
"Test Early, Test Often" - Implement comprehensive testing at every stage with both dummy and real devices to ensure reliability and prevent issues.

### Testing Levels

#### 1. Unit Testing (Continuous)
**Scope:** Individual components and functions
**Frequency:** With every code commit
**Coverage Target:** 90%

**Test Categories:**
- Configuration parser accuracy tests
- API endpoint functionality tests
- Algorithm logic validation tests
- Error handling and edge case tests

**Example Unit Tests:**
```python
def test_cisco_bgp_parser():
    """Test BGP configuration parsing for Cisco devices"""
    config = """
    router bgp 65001
     neighbor 10.1.1.1 remote-as 65002
     neighbor 10.1.1.1 description ISP_Connection
    """
    result = CiscoConfigParser().parse_bgp(config)
    assert result['asn'] == 65001
    assert len(result['neighbors']) == 1
    assert result['neighbors'][0]['ip'] == '10.1.1.1'

def test_confidence_scoring():
    """Test confidence scoring algorithm"""
    test_config = get_test_configuration()
    confidence = ConfidenceScorer().calculate_score(test_config)
    assert 0 <= confidence <= 100
    assert isinstance(confidence, float)
```

        device = self.connect_to_device(device_ip)
        
        # Save baseline
        self.baseline_configs[device_ip] = device.get_config()
        
        # Deploy test config
        test_config = """
        router bgp 65001
         neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 65002
        """
        
        try:
            result = device.configure(test_config)
            
            # Verify BGP neighbor establishment
            bgp_status = device.execute("show ip bgp summary")
            success = "65002" in bgp_status
            
            # Generate test report
            return {
